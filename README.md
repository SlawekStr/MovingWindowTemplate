# MovingWindowTemplate

This is a C++ window template that provides a basic window using the SFML graphics library, with functionality for moving the camera by panning and zooming within the window. The camera movement system can be controlled using mouse input, and allows for smooth movement and scaling of the viewport. This template can serve as a starting point for creating 2D graphics applications or games in SFML, and can be customized and expanded upon as needed.
